 About me
======
Currently an industrial Ph.D student at Uppsala University and the radiotherapy company Elekta Instrument AB. My research is about motion modeling for medical image sequences, so-called intra-intervetional medical images. Such sequences often suffers from sparse temporal and spatial resolutions. By modeling the dynamics we aim to estimate the motions in unobserved states, like forecasting and interpolation between observed images in time, and extrapolation to spatially unobserved positions.
